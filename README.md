# QR-code-generator
A simple QR code generator made using python.

You need to get an API key from ( https://api-ninjas.com/ ) , and add it in the code instead of "YOUR_API_KEY".

To run this you need to run these in your terminal:

```pip install tkinter```

```pip install requests```

You also need the 'codes' folder in your directory.
